To use VirtualIce, download and place the contents of the ice_images/ directory in the EMPIAR-12287 entry (https://doi.org/10.6019/EMPIAR-12287) to this directory. The directory should consist of vitrified buffer micrographs (MRC format), JSON files created by labeling obscuring objects with AnyLabeling and with the same base filenames as the micrographs, and a single text file named good_images_with_defocus.txt that has a list of all .mrc micrographs in the first column and a space-delimited second column with the micrographs' average defocus value in microns.
