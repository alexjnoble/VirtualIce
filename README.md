# VirtualIce: Synthetic CryoEM Micrograph Generator

VirtualIce is a feature-rich synthetic cryoEM micrograph generator that uses buffer cryoEM micrographs with junk and carbon masked out as real background. It projects Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures onto buffer cryoEM micrographs, simulating realistic imaging conditions by adding noise and applying CTF to particles.

#### Features

- Generates synthetic cryoEM micrographs from PDB IDs or local PDB files.
- Supports MRC, PNG, and JPEG output formats.
- Incorporates realistic imaging conditions including Poisson and Gaussian noise.
- Applies Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) to simulate microscope optics.
- Multi-core processing for efficient image generation.
- Extensive customization options including particle distribution, ice thickness, and microscopy parameters.

## Installation

VirtualIce requires Python 3, EMAN2, IMOD, and several dependencies, which can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib opencv-python-headless mrcfile
```

## Usage

The script can be run from the command line and takes a number of arguments.

Example usage for generating synthetic micrographs:

```
./virtualice.py -p 1TIM -n 100 --png --jpeg -s 4
```

## Arguments

- `-p`, `--pdbs`: Specify PDB IDs or paths to local PDB files.
- `-n`, `--num_images`: Number of micrographs to generate.
- `--mrc`, `--png`, `--jpeg`: Output format options.
- `-s`, `--scale`: Scaling factor for particle images.
- `-a`, `--apix`: Angstrom per pixel for the output images.
- `-c`, `--cpus`: Number of CPU cores to use.

Additional arguments for fine-tuning the generation process including binning, noise simulation levels, and CTF application parameters.

## Ethical Use Agreement

VirtualIce is under the MIT License, allowing broad usage freedom, but we emphasize using it responsibly and ethically via these guidelines:

### Intended Use

VirtualIce is designed for educational and research purposes, specifically to aid in the development, testing, and validation of cryoEM image analysis algorithms by generating synthetic cryoEM micrographs and particles.

### Ethical Considerations

- **Transparency**: Any data generated using VirtualIce should be clearly marked as synthetic when published or shared, to distinguish it from real experimental data.
- **No Misrepresentation**: Users should not present synthetic data generated by VirtualIce as real data from physical experiments in any publications or presentations unless explicitly stated.
- **Research Integrity**: We encourage users to uphold the highest standards of scientific integrity in their work, ensuring that the use of synthetic data does not mislead, deceive, or otherwise harm the scientific community or the public.

### Embedding Metadata

To help enforce transparency, VirtualIce embeds metadata within each generated micrograph and particle file indicating that the data is synthetic. This metadata is designed to be tamper-evident, providing a means to verify the origin of the data.
